FAQ Collapse

HTML: The HTML code creates the basic structure of the page. It includes head section with a meta tag, a title, a link to a font library, and a link to a CSS file. The body section contains an H1 header, a container for FAQ items, and a reference to a JavaScript file. Each FAQ item consists of an H3 title, a paragraph text, and a button with two Font Awesome icons.

CSS: The CSS code provides the styling for the FAQ page. The CSS file is imported into the HTML document. The styles include setting the font-family, background color, margin, padding, and other visual effects.

JavaScript: The JavaScript code is not included in the HTML file. It would interact with the HTML to add dynamic behavior to the FAQ page, such as hiding and showing the text when the button is clicked.
